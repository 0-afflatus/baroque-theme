Baroque is a Gtk theme, based on Marcus Petzoldt's Aero theme. It provides a dark wooden background with gold, ruby and amethyst fittings. It is intended as a modern re-invention of the original Pixmap theme.

It is a dark theme, which provides unusual challenges. While I am interested in reports of widgets not displaying properly or unreadable text in specific circumstances, if you find this theme really hurts your eyes, it's probably best to go back to a lighter theme. This gtk-1.2 theme is really just for backwards compatibility, I'm probably not going to bother maintaining it unless someone hassles me.

The most recent version of Baroque can be found at themes.freshmeat.net.


INSTALLATION
------------

The simplest way to do this is simply drag and drop the tarball on to the Theme Preferences dialogue (Menu: Desktop->Preferences->Theme). You can also unpack the tarball into your ~/.themes directory and use gconf-editor to switch
theme.
