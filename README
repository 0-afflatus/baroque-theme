    Baroque Gtk Theme
<{~-==|:|##.v.##|:|==-~}>

Baroque is a dark GTK3/2 theme. It's a rather steampunk affair, featuring mahogany dashboards with brass fittings tastefully set with rubies and amethysts.

There is an accompanying icon theme, which plays fast and loose with the Tango standards, whilst maintaining efficiency and decorum.

Its operation may be slightly imperfect with these new-fangled pseudo-3d desktops. Should it break, you get to keep all the little brass cogs.

There is room for improvement in many of the icons; contributions welcome. The aim is to maintain compatibility with GPL and Free Desktop standards. Also to create a look that is as unlike Windows, OSX or indeed any other proprietary operating system, whilst maintaining efficiency and beauty.
