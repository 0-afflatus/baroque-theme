# Baroque Gtk Theme

<{~-==|:|##.v.##|:|==-~}>

Baroque is a dark GTK3/2 theme. It's a rather steampunk affair, featuring mahogany dashboards with brass fittings tastefully set with rubies and amethysts.

There is an accompanying icon theme https://github.com/0-afflatus/baroque-icon-theme, which plays fast and loose with the Tango standards, whilst maintaining efficiency and decorum.

Its operation may be slightly imperfect with these new-fangled pseudo-3d desktops. Should it break, you get to keep all the little brass cogs.

There is room for improvement in many of the icons; contributions welcome. The aim is to maintain compatibility with GPL and Free Desktop standards. Also to create a look that is as unlike Windows, OSX or indeed any other proprietary operating system, whilst maintaining efficiency and beauty.

I began work on this theme in 2009 and in 2012 updated it to support gtk3, so this isn't really a fresh release. I am making it publicly available in the hope of attracting collaborators.

## Compatibility

Gnome-classic, xfce and openbox
This theme should work (more or less) with all gtk based desktops / window-managers.
Issues relating to DFSG compliance are welcomed.
